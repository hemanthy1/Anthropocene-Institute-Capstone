## Description
As apart of our senior capstone project at Michigan State University, we teamed up with the [Anthropocene Institute](https://anthropoceneinstitute.com) and set out to create a machine learning model that analyzes methods of removing carbon dioxide from the Earth's atmosphere. The end goal and essence of the project is optimizing the location and cost of future projects within the field of carbon sequestration and environmental sustainability as a whole, all displayed in a user-friendly web application.
